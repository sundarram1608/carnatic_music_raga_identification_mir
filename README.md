# Carnatic Music Raga Identification using MIR + Deep Learning

Carnatic music is one of the oldest and most historic music systems in the world. Raga is the single most crucial melodic framework of this music art form that provides the rules and notes for a Carnatic composition.Learning to identify a song’s raga is a core competency developed during an Indian Carnatic music education. Therefore, Raga recognition is an important step in computational musicology & MIR as far as Indian Carnatic music is considered. <br> <br> This Project aims to leverage MIR techniques to extract and analyze Carnatic audio for 8 melakartha ragas, followed by building a fusion deep learning model (CNN+LSTM) for Raga classification.
